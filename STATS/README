Program to compute the statistics for the Giometto case.
1) check and SET the parameters in the SETTINGS.h file.
2) check that the z.dat file is in the current STATS directory. It should contain the z-component of the grid stencil (dimensionful values [metres]).
3) to RUN the program, do:
  
   bash RUN.sh

   inside the current STATS directory.

NOTE: please do NOT modify the hierarchy of the existing directories, otherwise the program will not work.
